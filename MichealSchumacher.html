	<h2>Story Behind The Print</h2>
	<p>TRVL Art, in cooperation with Scuderia Ferrari and Keep Fighting Foundation, has created a series of design posters to capture one of the most historic moments of Formula 1 history, and Michael Schumacher’s favorite and most crucial victory: his title-clinching win at Japanese GP with his Ferrari F1-2000.
        This design poster celebrates this extraordinary accomplishment and honors Michael Schumacher’s 50th birthday by featuring his 2000-season helmet. 
        It has been recreated in awe-inspiring detail using 3D-modelling and 3D-scanning of the actual helmet, and took our team of specialist artists, technicians and designers several months to complete.
        By owning this bold reminder of a historical F1 moment in the form of a strictly limited poster, you will also be donating to Keep Fighting Foundation, a non-profit organization founded by Michael Schumacher's family, life-long friends and colleagues.
    </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Uniquely designed and created by Automobilist's team of artists</li>
		<li>Uses the latest 3D modelling technology to rebuild the helmet from scratch</li>
		<li>Comes as a standard sized poster, 50 x 70 cm (19¾ x 27½ inch), framing not included</li>
		<li>Reproduced as a high quality offset print on 175g/m2 paper</li>
        <li>Ships worldwide from South Africa, rolled and delivered in a protective tube</li>
        <li>By buying this product, you donate to Keep Fighting Foundation, a non-profit organization founded by Michael Schumacher's family, life-long friends and colleagues</li>
	</ul>
